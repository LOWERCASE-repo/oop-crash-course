### DSC Review Session Two
- object oriented programming crash course + review requests
- prerequisites: methods, conditionals, loops (functional programming basics)
- goal is to get everyone to a point they can focus on problem solving instead of stumbling over oop (or at least to a point where they can study on their own without backtracking too much)
- if you're confident with lab ten, this crash course will likely be beneath you
